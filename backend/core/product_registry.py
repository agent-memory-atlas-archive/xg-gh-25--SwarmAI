"""Shared PRODUCT registry — the workspace-level source both the Artifacts overlay
and the Canvas rail will project from (Artifacts B′ Run 1; design_doc art_5c8787b5).

WHAT THIS OWNS
    A durable, WORKSPACE-LEVEL store of user-facing PRODUCTS (decks, reports,
    images, design docs) at ``<SwarmWS>/.artifacts/products.json`` — distinct from
    the PER-PROJECT pipeline-stage artifacts ``artifact_registry.py`` holds. Both
    the Artifacts overlay (today: git-log projection) and the Canvas rail (today:
    per-tab sessionStorage) will, in Run 2, read from this ONE store instead of
    their two lossy derived views.

WHY A NEW CLASS, NOT A SUBCLASS (THINK-stage decision, Gate-1 confirmed)
    ``ArtifactRegistry`` threads a ``project`` arg through every method — its
    keyspace is PER-PROJECT (``Projects/<p>/.artifacts/``). A product can land
    ANYWHERE (``Knowledge/``, any ``Projects/*``, or be gitignored), so the store
    must be FLAT + workspace-level. Subclassing would pass a sentinel project into
    every base method and pollute the base semantics. Instead this reuses the
    PRIMITIVES ``ArtifactRegistry`` is built on — ``utils.file_lock`` (flock) + an
    atomic write-temp+rename — never the class.

THE GATE-1 FIX (the load-bearing design point)
    ``register_batch`` classifies RAW paths INDEPENDENTLY of the surface verdict.
    A gitignored deck (``Projects/AIDLC/assets/deck.html``) is
    ``needs_human_review`` → ``review_worthy=False, kind=process`` (the git-ignore
    Layer-1 drop), so it is filtered OUT of ``workspace_surface_watcher``'s
    ``verdicts.items()`` emit loop before ``abs_path`` is even assigned. If the
    product write rode that loop, gitignored decks — exactly the products that must
    surface — would NEVER register. So the write hook feeds ``register_batch`` the
    RAW batch paths, and this module does its OWN classification via a small
    positive PRODUCT_DIR_ALLOWLIST that short-circuits the gitignore drop, WITHOUT
    un-gating secrets/scratch (the allowlist is narrow: product dirs only).

DELEGATION (never a parallel walk — run_847ed9f9 / run_4de279ca)
    Location (owned vs external) → ``artifact_source.classify_source`` /
    ``needs_human_review._owning_tree``. Content-kind → ``needs_human_review.
    _classify_kind``. This module adds only the PRODUCT-role mapping + the store.

CONCURRENCY & DURABILITY
    Every ``products.json`` mutation runs under an exclusive flock on a
    ``.products.lock`` sidecar (read-modify-write serialized across processes), and
    the write is atomic (temp file + ``os.replace``). Same guarantees as
    ``ArtifactRegistry._mutate_manifest`` / ``_write_manifest``, same primitives.

    MECHANISM: flock is advisory + bound to the fd/inode (NOT the path — never
    unlink the lock to "release" it). Atomic replace is same-directory rename.
    VERIFY: mirrors artifact_registry.py:411 (flock) + :446 (mkstemp+replace),
    both production-verified; utils.file_lock carries the Windows byte-range branch.
