"""Artifact source classification — link vs copy (Artifact-Lifecycle P0, ①).

WHAT THIS OWNS
    ``classify_source(abs_path, swarmws_root=None) -> (Literal['link','copy'], reason)``:
    a PURE decision about how a registered artifact relates to its backing file.

      - ``link`` — the file lives inside a tree we own (SwarmWS or a bound-repo
        worktree). The artifact is a LIVE POINTER: content is read from disk on
        open and diffed via git (``baseRef``). The file IS the artifact.
      - ``copy`` — the file is disposable / external / not-a-file. If a version
        store ever captures it (P1), it captures the BYTES; the on-disk original
        is not authoritative.

WHY IT DELEGATES (the load-bearing design decision — Gate-0 SUPPORTED)
    Tree ownership already has ONE canonical resolver: ``needs_human_review._owning_tree``.
    ``canvas_surface.is_canvas_surfaceable`` already reuses it "so the boundary can
    never drift (P8)". This module does the SAME — it is a THIN WRAPPER, never a
    second ``.git`` walk-up. A parallel classifier would drift from ``_owning_tree``
    (run_4de279ca: "a second denylist drifts"). So:

        owned by a known tree  → link   (delegated to _owning_tree)
        not owned + noise/tmp  → copy   (delegated to canvas_noise.is_noise_path)
        not owned + otherwise  → copy

    Disposable-root precedence ("a tmp clone is still disposable even though it has
    its own .git") is satisfied FOR FREE: ``_owning_tree`` only knows SwarmWS + bound
    worktrees, so an external ``/tmp/x/.git`` is never owned → None → the fallback's
    ``is_noise_path`` catches the tmp root. No explicit ordering code is needed.

SECURITY
    A ``link`` verdict's tree root authorizes later reads, so ``/`` and ``$HOME`` are
    never link roots. ``_owning_tree`` structurally cannot return them (SwarmWS is a
    specific subdir, worktrees are specific dirs), and we additionally hard-refuse
    them defensively. Non-absolute / empty / NUL-bearing input → ``copy`` (declined,
    never raised) — mirrors ``canvas_surface``'s "not ours to classify → decline".
