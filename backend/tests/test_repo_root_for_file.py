"""Cross-repo files_touched resolution for run-commit (run_a5999658, Part B).

`_repo_root_for_file` must resolve a files_touched entry to its OWNING git repo:
- an ABSOLUTE path → the repo of its own parent (unchanged, back-compat);
- a RELATIVE path pointing into the SwarmWS workspace → the SwarmWS repo, even
  when the process cwd is a DIFFERENT repo (the swarmai launch repo). Before the
  fix, a relative SwarmWS path resolved against Path.cwd() (swarmai) → the file
  read as "does not exist on disk" → run-commit dropped it → COMPLETE gate blocked
  on uncommitted_source.
