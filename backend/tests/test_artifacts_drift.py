"""Tests for ``GET /artifacts/drift`` (Artifact-Lifecycle P0, ②).

WHAT IS TESTED
    The drift endpoint answers "has this file changed on disk since the row was
    created?" for a Canvas OUTPUT / Artifacts-overlay row. Response shape:
    ``{dirty: bool, reason: 'git-changed'|'mtime-newer'|'missing'|'clean', current_ref?: str}``.

METHODOLOGY
    Real ASGI (httpx.ASGITransport over the FastAPI app) + a REAL tmp git repo.
    ``artifacts._get_workspace_path`` is monkeypatched to the tmp repo so the
    endpoint runs against a controlled tree. Only the workspace resolution is
    substituted — git itself is real (the whole point is exercising real git).

KEY PROPERTIES / INVARIANTS (AC4)
    - tracked file whose last-commit sha != since_ref → dirty / git-changed
    - tracked file unchanged since since_ref → clean
    - untracked file with mtime(ms) > since_ms → dirty / mtime-newer
    - a deleted / absent path → missing (surfaced, not silent)
    - git error / uncomputable → clean (FAIL-SAFE: never a false dirty/missing)
      — the recovery-path test forces ``canvas_surface._git`` to return None.
